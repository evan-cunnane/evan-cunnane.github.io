        <h2>Work Report</h2>
        <p>I started this portfolio by adding a header with my name and a few things I do below it. I also added a logo that I made for an assignment for graphic design in semester 1 to add something extra to the header. For the "About me" section I added in text to the left of the screen and an image on the right of the screen making sure to use the bootstrap grid system to help with the sizing of the page on different devices such as laptops, phones and tablets.</p>
        <p>I then added 2 tables for the next section displaying elements such as skills,interests,Certifications and I recieved thos certifications. I added styles to these tables and also to all the images, img-fluid to have the image responsive on all screens, rounded for rounded corners and shadow to create a shadow effect on the images just for aestheics.</p>
        <p>In the "People Who Inspire Me" section i followed a similar layout to the about me section except i added subheadings, a link to a video and I have two images on the right corresponding to who the paragraphs opposite are about(Nick Mira and Jonny Greenwood).</p>
        <p>The "My Music section was a fun section to do because I had the idea of wanting to have a way of playing the song without leaving the page or even playing a snippet but was unable to figure it out so I decided to have he album cover as the link directly to the song on Soptify but I wanted there to be more to it then just a link so I figured out how to make the image increase in size when the mouse hovers over the image and decrease ack to the original size when the mouse leaves the image.</p>
        <p>I did experience difficulties while doing this project. I found myself reffering to the lectures, labs and Youtube videos to help me get over any hurdles I encounters. Some of the difficulties I came across where making sure the whole page would be responsive to other devices and coding the image to animate and act as a link I found difficult but once I figured everything out I was very happy. Another difficulty I had was with GitHub and the different templates, uploading the files and the structure. As someone who has never done coding like this or uploaded any sort of website before I did find this frustrating even with the video tutorial. The video tutorial was helpful but my Github is different to his so I had to look elsewhere for a solution, which could possibly effect the outcome of this portfolio/grade of the portfolio. </p>
