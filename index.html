             <hr class="section-divider">
            <p>Hi, My name is Evan Cunnane. I have been creating and producing music since late 2019. I've always loved music and wanted to persue it as a career but never had a voice for it until I found out about the production side and it's been an uncontrollable obsession ever since. I have produced songs for artists all over the world, e.g. America, UK and Ireland. I have learned and used many different softwares such as Ableton Live, FL Studio, Reaper and am currently learning MaxMSP.</p>
            <p>I am currently a first year in the University of Limerick, studying Music, Media and Performacne Technology. During my first year in UL I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills in areas such as music, processing, graphic design and web development.</p>
            <p>My main focuses right now are on my studies in UL but when I want to take a break from that I am usually in a music studio. I am currently working on an ambient album which will be called "Everything All At Once". Ive been working on this porject with a friend of mine called Shane, who is mainly a guitar player but is a multi instrumentalist. I plann to have this album and hopefully a few B-Sides ready for release by the middle of summer 2025.</p>

                <p>The first time i discovered music production, it was around 4am i was scrolling on YouTube and I accidently clicked on a video of Nick Mira creating a beat around an artists acapella. I instantly fell in love with what I was seeing. That same day i downloaded FL Studio and began learning everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/IzSSHjTQ9cg?si=HRjXXE06dFxT1j22" target="_blank" class="video-link">The video I watched that night</a>.</p>
                <p>Nick Mira taught me the basics of music production, i would religiously listen to everything he produced, watch every live stream he would do and just watch and learn. I studied everything about the instruments and effects he used. </p>

                <h3 class="sub-heading-title">Jonny Greenwood</h3>
                <p>During my year out my ambition was sky high with music, i had plans to release and produce as much tracks as possible. Unfortunately I hit a major wall, i went from making 10 or so beats a day to maybe finishing 5 in a month. It was a horrific year, i began to think of letting my dream of being a musician go as I felt like I was just doing the same thing over and over. That was until I was properly introduced to one of the greatest bands I've ever hear, Radiohead. Jonny Greenwood is the lead guitarist and multi instrumentalist for Radiohead. </p>
                <p>Jonny Greenwood single handly revived my love for music. His musical ability and way of thinking about music is unlike anyone I have ever come across. I am now studying Jonny and similarly to Nick studying everything he has done. From work he's done with Radiohead, film composing and The Smile. I analyse how he plays his instruments and why he chooses the chords and notes he does, his use of strings in majority of his music. I have books breaking down every bit of music theory in every song in all 9 Radiohead albums. I never realised you could break the rules of music that much until I started listening to Radiohead. Radiohead will forever be my favourite band. Jonny Greenwood, Thom Yorke, Colin Greenwood, Phil Selway and Ed O'Brien are the reason I will keep and never stop persuing music.</p>
